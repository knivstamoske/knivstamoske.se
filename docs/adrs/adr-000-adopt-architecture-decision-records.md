# ADR-000: Adopt Architecture Decision Records

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2025-08-01

## Context

Software projects evolve over time and involve many architectural and technical decisions. These decisions are often made by different team members and at different points in time. Without proper documentation, the reasoning behind important decisions can be lost, leading to:

- Confusion about why certain technologies or patterns were chosen
- Difficulty onboarding new team members
- Challenges for AI tools and Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand project context
- Risk of making contradictory decisions or reverting good decisions due to lack of context
- Repeated discussions about already-settled topics

We need a systematic approach to document significant architectural decisions and their rationale.

## Decision

We will adopt Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural and technical decisions in this project.

ADRs will follow this format:

- **Title:** A short, descriptive title prefixed with ADR number (e.g., "ADR-001: Adopt SvelteKit as Primary Web Framework")
- **Status:** Determined by Git workflow
  - "Proposed" for ADRs in open pull requests
  - "Accepted" when merged to main branch
  - "Rejected" if pull request is closed without merging
  - On the main branch, status can only be "Accepted", "Deprecated", or "Superseded"
- **Date:** The date when the decision was made (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Context:** The circumstances and constraints that led to this decision
- **Decision:** The actual decision that was made
- **Consequences:** Both positive and negative outcomes expected from this decision

ADRs will be:

- Stored in the `docs/adrs/` directory
- Written in Markdown format
- Named using the pattern `adr-XXX-short-description.md`
- Numbered sequentially starting from 000
- Created via pull requests to enable discussion and review
- Automatically get status "Accepted" when pull request is merged to main branch
- Immutable once accepted (new ADRs should supersede old ones if needed)

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Creates a historical record of important decisions and their reasoning
- Helps new team members understand project evolution and architectural choices
- Provides valuable context for AI tools and LLMs working with the codebase
- Reduces time spent re-discussing settled decisions
- Improves code review quality by referencing decision rationale
- Forces deliberate thinking about architectural choices
- Creates searchable documentation for future reference
- Enables better handovers between team members
- Git workflow integration ensures clear status tracking and enables discussion via pull requests
- Pull request process allows for community review and feedback before acceptance

**Negative:**

- Requires discipline to maintain and write ADRs consistently
- Additional overhead in the development process
- Risk of ADRs becoming outdated if not properly maintained
- May slow down decision-making process initially
